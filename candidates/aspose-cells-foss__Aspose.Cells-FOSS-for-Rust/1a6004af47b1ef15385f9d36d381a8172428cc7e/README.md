[![Aspose.Cells FOSS for Rust](https://products.aspose.org/media/cells/rust/banner-readme.png)](https://products.aspose.org/cells/rust/)

Aspose.Cells FOSS for Rust provides a native Rust API for creating, reading, converting, and manipulating Excel workbooks and worksheets without requiring Microsoft Excel. It enables developers to programmatically write cell values such as strings, integers, booleans, decimals, and dates using methods like `put_value_string` and `put_value_i32`, and to compute formulas with cached results via `put_formula_with_cached_value`. Users can load existing Excel files in XLSX format from a file path, byte array, or stream using `Workbook.new` and `load_xlsx`, `load_xlsx_from_bytes`, or `load_xlsx_from_stream`, and inspect loaded content with methods like `get_string_value`, `get_int_value`, `get_bool_value`, `get_display_string_value`, and `get_formatted_string_value`. The library supports styling, formatting, filtering, freezing panes, and adding charts, shapes, comments, hyperlinks, and data validation rules, making it suitable for server-side spreadsheet processing in Rust applications.

## Key Capabilities

- **Create and load workbooks.** Create a new workbook with `Workbook.new` or load an existing .xlsx file from a path, a stream, or in-memory bytes, with optional package repair via `LoadOptions.try_repair_package`.
- **Typed cell value handling.** Write typed cell values including strings, 32-bit integers, booleans, decimals, and date-time values using `CellMut` methods, and read them back with `Cell` methods that return the corresponding Rust types.
- **Formula support with cached values.** Enter formulas with precomputed cached values using `CellMut.put_formula_with_cached_value` and retrieve the displayed or formatted string representation of a cell with `Cell.get_display_string_value` or `Cell.get_formatted_string_value`.
- **Styling and formatting.** Apply cell styling through `CellStyle` with `Font`, `Fill`, `Border`, and `NumberFormat` settings, and apply targeted updates using `StyleFlag` to modify only specific style attributes.
- **Conditional formatting and validation.** Enforce data validation rules and apply conditional formatting including cell-value conditions, expressions, color scales, data bars, and icon sets using `Validation`, `ValidationCollection`, `FormatCondition`, and `ConditionalFormattingCollection`.
- **Worksheet structure management.** Manage worksheet structure through `Worksheets` for sheet enumeration and `Worksheet` for individual sheet properties, plus freeze panes, auto-filters, row and column sizing, and page setup via `PageSetup`.
- **Charts, pictures, and shapes.** Insert charts of multiple types including column, line, bar, pie, and scatter variants using `ChartCollection` and `ChartType`, embed pictures with `PictureCollection`, and add drawing shapes with `Shape` and preset `AutoShapeType` geometries.
- **Document properties and metadata.** Attach hyperlinks, workbook- and sheet-scoped defined names, and cell comments with author and visibility control, and read or write core and extended document properties as well as sparkline groups for in-cell trend visualization.

## Installation

## Dependencies

### Required Package Dependencies

- `base64 0.22`
- `chrono 0.4`
- `getrandom 0.3`
- `roxmltree 0.20`

## Quick Start

This example creates a new workbook, writes several typed cell values and a formula with a cached result, saves the file as XLSX, and then loads it back to verify the content.

```rust
use aspose_cells_foss_rust::{CellValue, Workbook};
use std::error::Error;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // Create a new workbook (starts with one sheet, "Sheet1").
    let mut workbook = Workbook::new();
    {
        let mut worksheets = workbook.get_worksheets_mut();
        let sheet = worksheets.get(0)?;
        let mut cells = sheet.get_cells_mut();

        cells.get("A1")?.put_value_string("Hello")?;
        cells.get("B1")?.put_value_i32(123)?;
        cells.get("C1")?.put_value_bool(true)?;
        cells.get("D1")?.put_value_decimal(12.5)?;
        cells.get("F1")?.put_value_i32(10)?;
        cells.get("G1")?
            .put_formula_with_cached_value("=F1*2", CellValue::Number(20.0))?;
    }
    workbook.save("hello.xlsx")?;

    // Load it back.
    let loaded = Workbook::load_xlsx("hello.xlsx")?;
    let sheet = loaded.worksheet("Sheet1")?;
    let cells = sheet.get_cells();
    println!("A1 = {}", cells.get("A1")?.display_string_value());

    Ok(())
}
```

## API Reference

The Aspose.Cells FOSS for Rust library exposes the `Workbook` class as its primary entry point, which manages a collection of `Worksheet` objects and provides methods to load, create, and save Excel workbooks. Each `Worksheet` exposes its cells through `get_cells` and `get_cells_mut`, enabling read and write access to individual `Cell` and `CellMut` instances.

The verified public surface has 213 types.

## Scope and Limitations

Aspose.Cells FOSS for Rust version 26.7.0 provides a Rust API to create, read, and write Excel workbooks in the .xlsx format, targeting the Rust 2021 edition and built for the rust ecosystem.

- The library supports only the .xlsx format and does not handle legacy .xls, ODS, or CSV files.
- Removing the last worksheet from a workbook is not allowed and returns a `CellsError`::Unsupported error.
- The public API surface is broad but incomplete compared to Aspose.Cells, with some features still partial as the crate is early-stage and evolving.
- No automated test suite is included, so cargo test --all-targets reports zero tests.
- The crate is not yet published to crates.io and must be added as a Git dependency.

These limitations don't apply to [Aspose.Cells — Enterprise Edition](https://products.aspose.com/cells/). The commercial Aspose.Cells for Rust product extends this package by adding support for additional file formats, advanced rendering capabilities, and enterprise-grade features such as document protection and batch processing.

## Development and Testing

Build and verify the library with standard Cargo commands, then run the included samples to confirm read/write round-trips: cargo build, cargo check --all-targets, cargo fmt --all --check, cargo clippy --all-targets, cargo bench, and cargo doc --no-deps --open; cargo test --all-targets reports 0 tests, so verify behavior with cargo run on the sample binaries.

Releases run through the [ci workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

```bash
cargo build
cargo check --all-targets
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets
cargo test --all-targets
cargo run --bin sample_basic
cargo run --bin sample_loading
cargo run --bin sample_styles
```
