#: segment are not emitted to api_surface.json, preventing them from ever
#: reaching batch_reference, enrichment, or site-plan steps.
#:
#: Segment matching is exact (split on ".") â€” "international" is NOT matched
#: by "internal".  To disable filtering pass
#: ``excluded_package_segments=frozenset()`` to ``extract_api_surface()``.

# for PptxExporter/OpcPackage/etc. â€” those must NOT be affected), C++'s
# `internal/` headers are unreachable from the library's public
# `#include <aspose/pdf/...>` surface and routinely reuse the SAME short struct

# is_public() (tree_helpers.py) already answers "is this declaration marked
# public at the syntax level," and for C#/Java that is sufficient to exclude
# `internal` types entirely -- they never reach api_surface.json in the first
# place (confirmed: cells/net's `internal class XmlParsingException` never
# appears in the output, because is_public() requires "public" among the
# accumulated modifier text). But two other languages positively INCLUDE
# items that are syntactically public/undecorated yet still unreachable by a
# real consumer importing the package:
#
#   Python: `class Foo` in a deeply-nested module is is_public()==True (no
#   leading underscore) and gets extracted -- but `from package import Foo`
#   only works if `package/__init__.py` actually re-exports it. Confirmed
#   live: words/python's DocumentReader/LdmDocxWriter are real, documented,
#   is_public()==True classes that are NOT in aspose/words_foss/__init__.py's
#   __all__ (only Document, SaveFormat, LoadFormat, saving are) --
#   `from aspose.words_foss import DocumentReader` raises ImportError for a
#   real reader of the generated docs page.
#
#   Rust: `pub struct Foo` inside a private `mod api;` is is_public()==True
#   (the struct itself carries a bare `pub`) but unreachable from outside the
#   crate unless `lib.rs` re-exports it via `pub use api::Foo;` (or the
#   enclosing module chain is itself `pub mod`). Confirmed live: cells/rust's
#   WorkbookModel is a `pub struct` inside `mod api;` (private) and is NOT in
#   lib.rs's `pub use api::{...}` list, so no consumer of the crate can ever
#   name it.
#
# Both helpers below are best-effort, single-file, regex-based scans (same
# spirit as the existing S-1 per-file __all__ extraction below) -- NOT full
# module-graph resolution. Any pattern they don't recognize (multi-level
# re-export chains, glob `pub use x::*`, conditional/computed __all__, etc.)
# makes them return None, and the caller then leaves every entry's
# `reachable` at the default True -- this is a strictly additive signal that
# only ever POSITIVELY marks an entry False; an unrecognized pattern must
# never manufacture a false negative.


# TC-MT040-42: the per-language algorithms formerly inlined here now live in

# as thin re-exporting wrappers -- unchanged names/signatures/behavior --
# because scout.py and several tests
# (test_api_surface_reachability.py, test_rust_extraction.py) import them
# directly from this module. No duplicate logic remains: each wrapper calls
# straight through to the single real implementation in lang/.

    """Re-assign stable, anchor-based IDs to scout-derived member claims.

    Root cause this fixes (G10, the "load-bearing" half): claim_id is a hash
    of full claim TEXT, so a real text change (e.g. a return-type formatting
    tweak, or added prose after re-extraction) produces a brand-new ID â€”
    indistinguishable from that member being removed and an unrelated one
    added. refresh_knowledge.py's modified_claims can only ever detect a
    "modified" claim if the SAME ID appears in both the old and new
    claims.json with different text; a text-hash ID can never satisfy that
    for a real text change, only for byte-identical re-extraction. Anchoring
    the ID to "ClassName.MemberName" instead makes a real modification
    visible as a real "modified" event for the first time.

    Mirrors enrich.py's _assign_ids() collision-resolution architecture
    exactly (see its own extensive docstring for the full rationale, measured
    against a real corpus): when more than one claim shares an anchor
    (overloaded methods -- Save(path) vs Save(stream) -- are common, not
    rare), only one deterministically-chosen claim (sorted by text, so the
    choice doesn't depend on extraction order) takes the anchor-based ID;
    every other claim sharing that anchor keeps the _make_claim-assigned
    full-text-hash ID it already has, rather than being dropped or silently
    colliding with the winner.

    Known, accepted, one-time transition cost (not a bug -- documented
    explicitly, matching this mission's own standard of surfacing tradeoffs
    rather than hiding them): the FIRST re-scout of an already-launched
    product after this change ships will assign a NEW anchor-based ID to
    each winning member claim, different from its old full-text-hash ID,
    even though nothing about the real API changed. Any already-published
    content page citing the old ID in its evidence.claims frontmatter will
    show that citation as orphaned until the page's evidence is next
    refreshed (S-20/page-update, or attach_evidence.py) -- exactly the class
    of event stale_detect.py's orphaned_claims detection and
    check_evidence_churn.py's citation-verification gate (Task 22, this same
    mission) already exist to correctly surface and govern, not a new,
    unhandled failure mode. From the SECOND re-scout onward, IDs are stable
    across rebuilds and this cost does not recur.

    """Mark Python classes re-exported via any package __init__.py.__all__.

    PY-INIT-001: Packages that define classes in _internal/ and re-export them
    from __init__.py use a legitimate "implementation hiding" pattern.  The
    per-file __all__ extraction (S-1) only sets visibility="exported" when the
    class definition and __all__ are in the SAME file.  Cross-file re-exports
    from __init__.py are invisible to that check.

    This post-pass unions all __all__ names from every __init__.py in the
    source tree and sets exported_via_package_init=True on matching classes.
    index.py._is_public_api_entry() checks this flag before applying the
    /_internal/ path filter, so re-exported classes are counted as public API.

    PY-INIT-002 (MT028-2026-08-09-FONT-PYTHON-BLIND-SPOT-HEAL, RC-font-python-02):
    an __all__ entry is only a real re-export if the name is ALSO actually bound
    in that same __init__.py (via an import, or a local def/class/assignment) --
    not merely present as a string literal inside __all__'s list. Upstream
    packages can and do carry an __all__ entry with no corresponding import (a
    real, live-verified example: aspose-font-foss-for-python's `BinaryReader`/
    `BinaryWriter` are listed in __all__ but never imported into the package
    namespace, so `from aspose_font import BinaryReader` genuinely raises
    ImportError). Treating such a name as public API mis-informs generated
    reference content into citing a class that is not actually importable.
    Verified via AST (ast.parse over the __init__.py source), not another
    regex, so relative-import forms, parenthesized multi-name imports, and
    `as`-aliases are all handled correctly, matching how Python itself
    resolves names -- the previous name-only-in-__all__ regex match is the bug
    this fixes, not the pattern to preserve. Do not fix the upstream repo
    itself (runs/.clone_cache/ is read-only per AGENTS.md 2a); this pipeline
    now correctly reports what the package's own __all__ inaccurately claims.

    PY-INIT-003 (MT028-2026-08-09-FONT-PYTHON-BLIND-SPOT-HEAL, RC-font-python-01):
    a boolean "is it exported somewhere" is not enough to construct a correct
    import statement -- a class can be re-exported by a SUBPACKAGE's
    __init__.py (e.g. aspose_font/cff/__init__.py re-exporting CffCharset)
    without being re-exported by the top-level package __init__.py at all.
    Live-verified against aspose-font-foss-for-python: `from aspose_font import
    CffCharset` raises ImportError, but `from aspose_font.cff import
    CffCharset` succeeds -- the class_import field ("cff.charset.CffCharset",
    the class's OWN defining module) is a different fact from where the class
    is genuinely re-exported and cannot substitute for it. When *pkg_root* is
    given, each entry also gets public_import_module: the dotted path (from
    pkg_root) of the __init__.py that genuinely re-exports it -- "" for the
    top-level package root, "cff" for a subpackage, etc. -- so a consumer can
    build `from {package}[.{public_import_module}] import {name}` exactly,
    instead of guessing from source-file location. When the same name is
    re-exported by more than one __init__.py, the shallowest (closest to
    pkg_root) wins, matching normal "prefer the top-level public path" intent.

    """Drop same-name Python class duplicates that are abandoned top-level
    compatibility shims shadowed by a real submodule implementation, or
    an unreferenced duplicate sitting alongside a confirmed-public sibling.

    Upstream packages sometimes leave a thin placeholder file at the
    package root (``formats/FbxLoadOptions.py``) after moving the real
    implementation into a per-format submodule
    (``formats/fbx/FbxLoadOptions.py``), without deleting the old file.
    Both are picked up as distinct classes by file-based extraction, and
    ``consolidate_classes`` treats differing ``canonical_namespace``
    values as genuinely different types (correct in general â€” this pass
    only removes duplicates it can positively resolve, before that
    generic logic runs).

    Two ordered signals, both deliberately conservative â€” a group is
    only narrowed to zero when there is positive evidence of curation
    that omits every candidate â€” a real, intentional same-name-
    different-module pattern exists in this codebase (e.g. pdf/python's
    ``Document`` + a separate ``generated/Document`` compatibility-shim
    *class*, HARDEN-py-canonical-namespace/MT013) and must not be
    mistaken for dead code just because no ``__init__.py`` curates the
    package's exports:
      1. Base-class presence: a class with zero bases next to a
         same-name class with real bases is almost always the abandoned
         placeholder â€” discard it.
      2. Package-init reachability: if bases don't disambiguate, keep
         only the entry whose defining file is actually the source of a
         ``from <path> import <Name>`` statement in some ``__init__.py``
         â€” but only when exactly one candidate is reachable.
      3. Whole-group drop: if none are reachable, only discard the
         entire group when EVERY candidate's own directory has a real,
         non-private ``__init__.py`` that had the chance to export it
         and didn't (e.g. all Token/TokenType duplicates sit in
         formats/fbx/, whose ``__init__.py`` curates other classes but
         never these). If even one candidate's directory has no
         ``__init__.py`` to check, that is an absence of evidence, not
         evidence of absence â€” leave the group untouched.

    If no signal cleanly resolves a group, it is left untouched for
    ``consolidate_classes``'s existing "different namespace, keep both"
    handling and downstream batch_reference disambiguation.

    # tests): `file_targets` (which files each file imports FROM, alias-
    # agnostic -- importing a module executes it regardless of what name
    # the imported symbol is bound to locally) and `unaliased_imports`
    # (name, target_file) pairs recorded ONLY when the import is NOT
    # aliased -- an aliased import (`from .cfb_writer import CFBWriter as
    # CFBWriterImpl`) deliberately does NOT count as evidence that
    # "CFBWriter" itself is reachable by that name, since nothing
    # downstream can ever refer to it as "CFBWriter" again. This
    # alias-awareness is what correctly separates cfb_writer.py's
    # CFBWriter (only ever referenced under the CFBWriterImpl alias --
    # stays excluded) from cfb_handler.py's CFBWriter (imported bare,
    # `from .cfb_handler import CFBReader, CFBWriter, is_encrypted_file`,
    # by xlsx_encryptor.py -- correctly recognized as reachable). Without
    # this distinction, a first version of this fix propagated file-level
    # reachability through the alias edge too and wrongly re-included
    # BOTH same-named classes again.
    #
    # `reachable_files` is then the set of files transitively imported
    # (any name, alias or not) starting from files already proven
    # reachable by the existing direct signals -- this generalizes signal
    # 2 without weakening the Token/TokenType exclusion, since
    # Token/TokenType's own importer (parser.py) has no import chain back
    # to any governed __init__.py either, so it never enters this set.
