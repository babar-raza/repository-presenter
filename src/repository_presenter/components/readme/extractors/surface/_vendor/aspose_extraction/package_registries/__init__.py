"""package_registries — per-registry publish-verification adapters.

Mission MT015-2026-07-30-PACKAGE-REGISTRY, TC-MT015-04. Each sibling module
(pypi.py, nuget.py, npm.py, go.py) exposes one function:

    check_published(candidate: dict, *, fetch=None) -> CheckResult

`candidate` is the registry-appropriate coordinate shape from a
data/package_registry.json entry (see data/schemas/package-registry-schema.json).
`fetch` is an injected `(url: str) -> FetchResponse | None` callable (None on
connection error/timeout) -- dependency injection instead of monkeypatching
`urllib`/`requests` (a T3 IO-boundary mock under AGENTS.md 16) so tests stay
fixture-based with zero live network calls and zero monkeypatch-lint concerns.

A CheckResult never asserts more than one real HTTP round trip determined --
callers must not flip `data/package_registry.json`'s `verification.published`
directly off one CheckResult. Use `apply_debounce()` below, which requires 2
consecutive agreeing "published" results (the mission's documented rerun-
consistency requirement: a single transient API error or ambiguous response
must never flip live-published state).

    candidate name contains "foss" in some form, OR corroborating metadata
    (the registry's own project/homepage URL) exactly references the product's
    known FOSS GitHub org/repo.

    Real case this guards against in both directions:
      - False negative: PyPI's `aspose-note` has no "foss" in its name but IS the
        genuine FOSS package -- its project_urls point exactly to
        github.com/aspose-note-foss/Aspose.Note-FOSS-for-Python. A purely
        mechanical "reject if no foss substring" rule would wrongly discard this.
      - False positive: PyPI's `aspose-page` (no "foss") is a genuinely unrelated
        *commercial* package with no FOSS connection at all -- accepting any
        name match without corroboration would have produced this exact
        collision (found 2026-08-01 during the full-repo audit).

    `expected_repo_fragment` is the identifying substring of the product's real
    FOSS GitHub org/repo (e.g. "aspose-note-foss" or "Aspose.Note-FOSS") -- callers
    supply this from the family's known repo_url, never guessed here.
