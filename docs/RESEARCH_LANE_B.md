# Lane B decision log (append-only; entries in RESEARCH_AND_GUIDELINES.md section 31 shape; the owner merges)

Lane: `lane-b` (project/lanes/lane-b.yaml). Prompt: project/loop-prompt-lane-b.md.

- **2026-09-06 · LANE-B-00 · the lane's Rust toolchain lives under `C:\tools\rp-toolchains\rustup`,
  not `runs/toolchains/`.** `RUSTUP_HOME` is `...\rustup\rustup-home`, `CARGO_HOME` is
  `...\rustup\cargo-home`, cargo is called by absolute path, and `rustup-init` ran
  `-y --profile minimal --no-modify-path --default-toolchain stable`, so no PATH or profile changed.
  Alternative rejected: `runs/toolchains/`, as G4-W16's parenthetical says. Evidence: `runs/` is
  gitignored disposable run state, so any clean re-downloads the toolchain inside W16's 2-hour box,
  and OWNER-06's GCC/Ninja already sit under `C:\tools\rp-toolchains` with `TOOLCHAIN_PATHS.txt` as
  the machine's toolchain registry; LANE-B-00's text (2026-09-06) names this root and is the later of
  the two. Reversal: repoint both variables at `runs/toolchains/` and re-run `rustup-init`; only the
  LANE-B-00 receipt records the path.
- **2026-09-06 · LANE-B-00 · OWNER-06's resume predicate is reproduced independently, not taken on
  trust.** The owner marked it `SATISFIED` in `state.yaml` at 81a10ac on the reviewer session's own
  probe; LANE-B-00 rebuilt the probe from scratch — `cmake 4.4.1 -G Ninja` configuring, building and
  running C++20 with `g++.exe` 16.2.0 and `ninja` 1.13.2 from `TOOLCHAIN_PATHS.txt`, three steps at
  exit 0, the binary printing `cxx202002 total=12`. Alternative rejected: read the file's `verified`
  line and move on. Evidence: LANE-B-00's own text says "verify", and a probe that uses
  `std::integral` and `std::views::filter` makes C++20 a compile requirement, not a claim. Reversal:
  none needed; G4-W13's remaining wait is G4-W10 and G4-W09.
- **2026-09-06 · LANE-B-00 · the lane's `tsc` is warmed now, into a disposable npm profile under
  `C:\tools\rp-toolchains\npm`.** `npm_config_prefix` and `npm_config_cache` point there, so nothing
  lands in the user profile and no PATH is edited; G4-W14's verifier calls `tsc` by absolute path or
  `npx.cmd` against that prefix. Alternative rejected: let `npx typescript` download inside G4-W14's
  2-hour box. Evidence: RESEARCH section 28.12 point 6 says provision toolchains before the cohort
  item that needs them, never inside its box. Reversal: delete the directory; `npx typescript` still
  works, at the cost of a download in the box.
